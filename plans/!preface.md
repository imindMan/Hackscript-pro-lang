# Preface

This plan is basically the plan for the language, specifically the structure of the language, the features
of the language and more!

Why not just make project in github? That's because I'd like to write some notes instead. It feels much more
natural to me.

# Hackscript the general plan

Hackscript can change, but the core concepts of the Hackscript philosophy will never change.

The Hackscript philosophy is called "HACKSCRIPT IN GENERAL", and it just received an update for the version 2.0. Don't really think there will be more updates for that, so I'll just leave here for reference.

(Inspire by: The Zen of Python)

```
HACKSCRIPT IN GENERAL (v2.0.0):
When you come to the world of Hackscript, you must know those rules to obey them. Or else, your code will f**k itself

Fundametal of Hackscript:
Hackscript is a useful, high-level, crazy-designed programming language, "the easy Malbolge", designed to hack your brain again.

Hackscript speech of itself:
"I'm the son of Malbolge, but I'm not cruel as hell" - Hackscript.

Rules of Hackscript: (or Theory of Hackscript)

#1: Malbolge-style mixes with high-level-style become Hackscript.
#2: No complete support, instead, deal with everything in Hackscript, with Hackscript no way escape.
#3: Completion can be done with replacement.
#4: Readability can be done with confusion.
#5: Nothing is empty, even the blocks.
#6: No curly braces and semicolons (C-like), but instead, parentheses (no semicolons).
#7: The code will and shall never be cleaned, instead, short and messy.
#8: Everything has to be organized, meaning it should be wrapped in parentheses.
#9: When dealing with complicated situation, use Hackcode.
#10: Once you accept to code with Hackscript, it means you accept to deal with hell. At that time,
     patience and short code are the only ways to win the game.
#11: Everything, as the name of "Hack", is a challenge in Hackscript.
#12: The purpose of Hackscript is to be a fun programming language with no way escape (like the hell), but also
     support high-level features to make it useful at some points.

Happy coding!
