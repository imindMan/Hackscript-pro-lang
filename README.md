# Introduction

Have you ever tried any esoteric programming language like Malbolge, Brainf\*\*k, etc.? <br>
The idea of this programming language came out when I tried to deal with these esoteric programming languages. And I wished to have a programming language that "looks like" esoteric programming language but still support some high-level things. So, HackScript was born at that time. <br>
It took me 3 months to first release the official version of HackScript (18/8/2022 at 9:06 PM (GMT +8)). So yeah, I hope you enjoy it! <br>


# Caution

#1: Even though this is the official version of HackScript, but still in Beta version, so there's something missing here, like no error occurs sometimes, so you can contribute freely. Read more in <a href="https://github.com/imindMan/Hackscript-pro-lang#contributions">#Contributions</a><br>
#2: This programming language is built on top of Python, so that's why it's super slow. But the purpose of this programming language isn't to build any serious project. But, hopefully, I'll make another HackScript based on C.<br>
#3: Read tutorials here: <a href="">Tutorial</a> to get the basic of HackScript, and be sure to read <a href="https://github.com/imindMan/Hackscript-pro-lang#the-sign-of-hackscript">the sign of HackScript</a> (in case you get some troubles actually) 

# The sign of HackScript
Note: you can read the sign of HackScript again by running this code <br>
```
&^ #"better_hackscript" 
    
chr ##
```
This is the whole content of The sign of HackScript.

Fundametal of HackScript:
HackScript is a Turing-complete, esoteric-style, the "easy Malbolge", and high-level programming language.
Rules of HackScript: (or Theory of HackScript)
    Note: By following the rules, HackScript makes its own style of code, known as HackScript-like syntax
#1: Esoteric-style mixs with high-level-style become HackScript
#2: Completion can be done with replacement 
#3: No complete support, instead, deal with everything in HackScript, with HackScript no way escape.
#4: No empty code blocks
#5: No curly braces and semicolons (C-like), but instead, parentheses and semicolons
#6: Readable can be done with confusion  
#7: No shorter code, instead, deal with nested thing and long code
#8: Everything has to be organized, meaning it should be wrapped in parentheses
#9: Everything, as the name of "Hack", is a challenge in HackScript.
#10: The purpose of HackScript is to be a fun programming language with no way escape (like esotoric), but also 
    support high-level features to make it useful at some points.
Happy coding!

# Installation
You can use it via python3<br>
Requirements:
```python >= 3.10``` <br>
<br>
The commands <br>
```> git clone https://github.com/imindMan/Hackscript-pro-lang.git```<br>
```> python <the-path-to-the-"Hackscript-pro-lang/hackscript.py-file"> <the-Hackscript-file(usually-is-*.hack)>```<br>
If you wanna use the executable file, you can clone it, and execute the project via pyinstaller (using ```pip install pyinstaller```) and use it.<br>

# Version

HackScript is in official release (contribution requires). Current version: `v1.0.0 (Beta-Official) HSO`


# Contributions
You can easily contribute the project by making a pull request and change something in the project <br>
Or, if you wanna build a library, you can make a pull request, and add your library in the <a href="https://github.com/imindMan/Hackscript-pro-lang/tree/master/library">library</a> directory. Note that the parameter in every functions, classes must be only one. Because HackScript will past a list of parameters into it.
