# Introduction

Have you ever tried any esoteric programming language like Malbolge, Brainf\*\*k, etc.? <br>
The idea of this programming language came out when I tried to deal with these esoteric programming languages. And I wished to have a programming language that "looks like" esoteric programming language but still support some high-level things. So, HackScript was born at that time. <br>
It took me 3 months to first release the official version of HackScript (18/8/2022 at 9:06 PM (GMT +8)). So yeah, I hope you enjoy it! <br>

The fundamental of HackScript: <br>
<code>
HackScript is a Turing-complete, esoteric-style, the "easy Malbolge", and high-level programming language
</code>
