Fundametal of HackScript:
HackScript is a Turing-complete, esoteric-style, the "easy Malbolge", and high-level programming language.
Rules of HackScript: (or Theory of HackScript)
#1: Esoteric-style mixs with high-level-style become HackScript
#2: Completion can be done with replacement
#3: No complete support, instead, deal with everything in HackScript, with HackScript no way escape.
#4: No empty code blocks
#5: No curly braces and semicolons (C-like), but instead, parentheses and semicolons
#6: Readable can be done with confusion
#7: No shorter code, instead, deal with nested thing and long code
#8: Everything has to be organized, meaning it should be wrapped in parentheses
#9: Everything, as the name of "Hack", is a challenge in HackScript.
#10: The purpose of HackScript is to be a fun programming language with no way escape (like esotoric), but also
support high-level features to make it useful at some points.
Happy coding!
